### 1. **Understand Core Concepts (1 - 2 Days)**
   
This phase is about laying a solid foundation for the more complex aspects of **RBAC**, **cloud security**, and **cloud computing**. The goal is to develop enough familiarity with the essential topics to understand papers and research later on.

#### Key Areas to Study:

### **Cloud Computing Basics**
   **What to Know:**
   - **Cloud Service Models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS):** 
     - **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service): Provides virtualized computing resources like storage and networking. **Example:** AWS EC2.
     - **PaaS** (Platform as a Service): Offers development platforms to build, test, and deploy apps without managing the underlying infrastructure. **Example:** Google App Engine.
     - **SaaS** (Software as a Service): Delivers software over the internet, fully managed by the provider. **Example:** Google Workspace.
   - **Deployment Models (Public, Private, Hybrid, Multi-cloud):**
     - Public Cloud: Services are delivered over the internet and shared among customers. **Example:** AWS, Azure.
     - Private Cloud: Used exclusively by one organization, either on-premises or hosted by a third party.
     - Hybrid Cloud: A mix of on-premises and cloud services.
     - Multi-cloud: Using multiple cloud services from different providers.
   - **Scalability & Elasticity:**
     - **Scalability** refers to the cloud’s ability to increase resources as demand grows.
     - **Elasticity** allows for dynamically adjusting resources based on current demand.

   **How Deep?**  
   Just know the definitions, common examples, and basic differences. Understand how **cloud scalability** and **elasticity** can impact security (e.g., when scaling, how do permissions adjust?).



### **Cloud Security**
   **What to Know:**
   - **Shared Responsibility Model:** 
     - The cloud provider is responsible for security **of** the cloud (infrastructure), while the user is responsible for security **in** the cloud (data, user access).
   - **Data Security:** 
     - Basic concepts of **encryption** (in-transit, at-rest), secure storage practices, and **data privacy**.
   - **Identity and Access Management (IAM):**
     - IAM controls who has access to what in cloud environments. **RBAC** is a subset of IAM.
   - **Common Threats:** 
     - **Insider threats**, **DDoS attacks**, **misconfigured cloud storage** (e.g., public access to private buckets), and **account hijacking**.
   - **Compliance:** 
     - Be aware of data protection laws like **GDPR** or **HIPAA** that apply to cloud security.

   **How Deep?**  
   Focus on the basic principles of cloud security and understand the types of **access control** measures in place. Familiarize yourself with terms like **IAM**, **data encryption**, and **compliance** requirements.


### **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**
   **What to Know:**
   - **Core Structure:** 
     - **Roles**, **permissions**, and **users**. A user is assigned a role, and roles are granted specific permissions.
   - **RBAC Variants:** 
     - Basic RBAC, **Hierarchical RBAC** (inheritance of roles), and **Constrained RBAC** (adding separation of duties).
   - **Limitations:** 
     - Static role assignments, lack of flexibility in dynamic cloud environments, and the difficulty of scaling for large or complex cloud services.
   - **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control):**
     - **ABAC** enhances RBAC by allowing access control decisions based on attributes (e.g., location, time, device type), offering more flexibility.

   **How Deep?**  
   Understand the structure and common use cases of RBAC, particularly in **enterprise** and **cloud systems**. Know its limitations, especially for cloud environments where roles need to be dynamic.


### **Related Concepts**
   **What to Know:**
   - **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA):** 
     - In **Zero Trust**, no one inside or outside the network is trusted by default. Continuous verification is required for access.
   - **Multi-Tenant Architecture:** 
     - In cloud computing, multiple customers (tenants) share the same infrastructure, with logical separation of data.
   - **IAM Systems:** 
     - **IAM** (Identity and Access Management) controls access, often using RBAC or ABAC as models. You’ll want a basic understanding of the IAM systems used by cloud providers like AWS or Azure.
   - **Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC):** 
     - Similar to ABAC, PBAC uses policies to dynamically assign permissions, often used in cloud systems.

   **How Deep?**  
   Be aware of these concepts, as they might be referenced when researching advanced cloud security techniques.


### **Expanded Actions:**
Here’s a realistic breakdown to get the most out of our limited timeframe:

#### **Day 1: Get the Basics Down**
   - **Action 1: Read Overview Articles and Watch Tutorials**
     - Read 1-2 **overview articles** on cloud computing (service models, deployment models, and key concepts like scalability).
     - Use platforms like **AWS or Google Cloud tutorials** to get quick introductions to cloud services and security.
     - Watch short tutorials on **RBAC** and **IAM** in cloud contexts (e.g., AWS IAM overview).

   **Recommended Sources**:
     - **AWS Getting Started Docs** (IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS basics)
     - **Google Cloud IAM tutorials**
     - YouTube/online tutorials on **RBAC basics** and **cloud security**.

   **Outcome:** Familiarity with basic cloud structures and security mechanisms.


#### **Day 2: Deepen Cloud Security and RBAC Knowledge**
   - **Action 2: Read 4-5 Short Papers or Articles**
     - Look for 4-5 papers or reports on **cloud security challenges** and **RBAC limitations** in cloud environments.
     - Focus on papers that cover real-world applications or case studies (e.g., cloud security breaches due to misconfigured IAM).
     - Make quick notes on **challenges** and **gaps** that catch your attention.

   **Recommended Sources**:
     - Search for **IEEE** or **ACM** papers on cloud security.
     - Check out blogs or whitepapers from **cloud providers** like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud on RBAC.

   **Outcome:** A working understanding of how RBAC functions in cloud environments and what limitations exist.

### 2. **Identify Trends and Challenges (1 Day)**
   Research current **trends** in both RBAC and cloud security:
   - What new technologies or methods are being introduced in cloud security?
   - What limitations or challenges are emerging with traditional RBAC systems in modern cloud environments?

   **Look for:**
   - **New technologies** (e.g., containerized apps, microservices) that might have unique security challenges.
   - **Hybrid models** of access control that combine RBAC with other security models.

   **Action:** Explore conference proceedings or industry reports on cloud security. Pay attention to what experts are saying about the **future of access control** in the cloud. Read papers from the last 1-2 years to ensure relevance.

### 3. **Narrow Down to Research Gaps (2 Days)**
   **Reading papers** is the core of this step, but here's a structured way to go about it:
   
   - **Step 1:** Search for papers that discuss **RBAC limitations** in cloud environments.
     - What problems do these papers identify? (e.g., **scalability issues, insider threats**)
   - **Step 2:** Look for papers that propose **solutions** to these issues but have unresolved aspects. These unresolved parts are potential research gaps.
   - **Step 3:** Investigate new areas like **AI-driven access control** or **policy automation** in the cloud to find novel topics.

   **Sources:**
   - IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library
   - Focus on papers from the last 3-5 years to ensure relevance.

### 4. **Brainstorm and Validate Ideas (1 Day)**
   Use your reading to **brainstorm topic ideas**, but here are some criteria to guide you:
   - **Feasibility**: Can this be researched and written within the given timeline?
   - **Originality**: Is this an incremental improvement on existing knowledge or something innovative?
   - **Relevance**: Will this topic be valuable to the industry or academia (consider future publication potential)?

   **Methods to Brainstorm:**
   - **Mapping Trends to Gaps**: E.g., If you find that RBAC doesn’t scale well in multi-tenant cloud environments, ask how machine learning or automation might improve it.
   - **Hybrid Approaches**: Can you combine models like RBAC with **Zero Trust** or **AI-driven decision-making**?

### 5. **Consult with Experts (Feedback Loop)**
   Once you have some rough ideas, **talk to your supervisor** or seek peer feedback. Present 2-3 potential ideas and get their input on the feasibility, impact, and novelty.

   **Goal:** Refine your ideas based on their feedback before finalizing.
